  <h2>CMP101 - Computer Hardware Architecture and Operating Systems </h2>
  <h3>Overall Grade: A+</h3>
  <p><b>UNIT 1 - 100% of module grade</b></p>
    <p><b>Grade: A+</b></p>
    <p>
    The assessment was to build something using the Wemos kit demonstrating an understanding of the basic concepts of hardware (e.g. binary, logic, serial comms, etc).<br>
    I made a weather station that does different things depending on which button you press, displaying images contained in byte arrays to indicate weather types, showing different temperatures etc. The dial controlled the brightness of the 7-segment display.<br>
    It also creates a rudmentary webserver on localhost:80 that you can use to wirelessly swap between features without physically pressing a button (Might take a few presses/be a bit delayed). Make sure to
    add in your wifi SSID and password.<br>

    Unit 2 involved the creation of a 301 darts program and then a subsequent 501 variation. I didn't do well in this so I'm not giving you the code. It wouldn't be helpful.

        <br>
    Note: This is very harshly graded. Only one person in 2022 got an A+. Nobody in 2023 did. The average grade this year was a C. Looking at past years work from before 2022 is of limited help owing to major course changes. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As such please find advice as to what to change in order to get an A+ on this below:
    <li> Follow the report writing quickies style strictly. Relying on your own report style will get you marked down generally. Following it will get you marked favourably. I largely used my own style here.</li>
    <li> Don't start a report with "This report" or a variation of it </li>
    <li> Don't say "given more time" in Future Work </li>
    <li>Make sure your discussion brings together ALL of the elements. Literally all of them. Reflect on the aims, talk about the background, the methodology, the procedure, the results. ALL OF IT. </li>

    Note: This is, in my opinion, the worst module you'll do at university. It's aimless. It gives you a tiny wordcount and expects you to deliver a full report. This is my least favourite unit of any module I had to do at university. It needs to be seriously reworked or entirely removed in my  view.
	I did not learn a single thing, and was largely giving the markers what they wanted: which clearly I failed to do.
