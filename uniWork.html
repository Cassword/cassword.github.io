    <p><b>Grade: A+</b></p>
    <p>
    The assessment was to build something using the Wemos kit demonstrating an understanding of the basic concepts of hardware (e.g. binary, logic, serial comms, etc).<br>
    I made a weather station that does different things depending on which button you press, displaying images contained in byte arrays to indicate weather types, showing different temperatures etc. The dial controlled the brightness of the 7-segment display.<br>
    It also creates a rudmentary webserver on localhost:80 that you can use to wirelessly swap between features without physically pressing a button (Might take a few presses/be a bit delayed). Make sure to
    add in your wifi SSID and password.<br>

    <h2>CMP417 - Engineering Resilient Systems</h2>
    <h3>Overall Grade: A</h3>
    <p><b>Part 1 -  Software Security</b></p>
    <p><b>Grade: A</b></p>
    <p>The entire premise of this module was that we were an IT manager of a small energy company. We were asked to pick from a given list of identified software systems that could be exploited, we were asked to choose one, then find similar systems that had been exploited on MITRE's CVE database. We then had to identify a class of security faults that might lead to a vulnerability on this system. We were then asked to recommend a software development practice that could be used to prevent this vulnerability in the context of the company (practicality, effectiveness, comparison with other practices) and specifically how it might have prevented an existing instance of exploitation.</p>
    <p> I chose static analysis as my method and employed both Semgrep and Snyk to do it.</p>

    <p><b>Part 2 -  Machine Learning</b></p>
    <p><b>Grade: B+</b></p>
    <p>This task asked us to design a machine learning classifier to categorize either network packet data or system memory dump files according to their attack category. This involved discussing two machine learning algorithms suitable for this problem including their strengths, weaknesses and limitations. We had to outline all stages of building a machine learning model including data ingestion/preprocessing, modelling, analysis and communication of results. Then, how we would test our proposed model using suitable evaluation metrics.</p>
    <p> I chose an implementation employing Random Forest as the algorithm.</p>

    <p><b>Part 3 -  Human-Centred Security</b></p>
    <p><b>Grade: A</b></p>
    <p>This unit asked us to review the literature on how phishing attacks & authentication design can compromise security then recommend a set of mitigations and mechanisms linked to the employees of the company. Recommendations then had to be made as to an authentication mechanism to secure internal applications considering a balance of security and usability, and methods that could improve resillience to phishing.</p>
