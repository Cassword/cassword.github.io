                        <p class="card-text">A: Basically paying it forward. Other people's coursework is really helpful for comparison and I know a ton of students use current grad's available work
                            to give them ideas/help structure. I did strongly debate it, but honestly I doubt I'll touch most of this (other than the webdev stuff - which this site is based off) again.
                            So it might as well help somebody.
